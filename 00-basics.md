JavaScript is:

* much higher-level than C/C++ or even Java
* interpreted (not compiled)
* will run with incorrect syntax, logic, or typing
* typed:
  * dynamically typed (types can be changed)
  * weakly typed (JS will try to auto-cast types)
  * duck-typed at runtime (everything is 1s and 0s, and JS figures out if 0x61 is a string or a number)
* functionally scoped
* case-sensitive
* single-threaded
* runs in a JavaScript engine
  * V8 (Chrome)
  * Node.js

JavaScript is not:

* object-oriented or class-based

JavaScript does not need semicolons, but they are good practice.
