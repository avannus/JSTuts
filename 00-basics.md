JavaScript is:

* much higher-level than C/C++ or even Java
* interpreted (not compiled), but modern engines use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation
* will often run with incorrect syntax, logic, or typing, but some errors will stop execution
* typed:
  * dynamically typed (types can be changed)
  * weakly typed (JS will try to auto-cast types)
  * duck-typed at runtime (type is determined by behavior, not explicit declaration)
* block-scoped (when using `let` and `const`)
* case-sensitive
* single-threaded, but can use asynchronous operations (event loop, promises, async/await)
* runs in a JavaScript engine
  * V8 (Chrome, Node.js)
  * SpiderMonkey (Firefox)
  * JavaScriptCore (Safari)

JavaScript is not:

* strictly object-oriented or class-based (but supports objects and classes)

JavaScript does not need semicolons, but they are good practice.

Why use JavaScript?

* Only language that runs natively in all major browsers
* Direct access to the DOM for real-time UI manipulation
* Asynchronous programming model built into the language (event loop, promises, async/await)
* Prototype-based inheritance for flexible object modeling
* Can be used for both client-side and server-side development with the same libraries and syntax (Node.js)
* Fast startup and execution due to JIT compilation and highly optimized engines (like V8)
* Seamless integration with browser APIs (Canvas, Web Audio, WebRTC, etc.)
* Easy deployment—no need for complex build or runtime environments
